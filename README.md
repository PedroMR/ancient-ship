# Ancient Ship

This was going to be my LD36 submission but alas, as usual, time during a weekend is really hard to come by.

It's a ship -- was going to be a mech but ack, physics on ground are hard -- where there's a bunch of modules that do things and get activated by randomly assigned controls every time you play.

Half the game is figuring out what the controls do; the other half is performing some tasks with it, e.g., power it up, hover above a giant block of stone, grapple it, move it to dam the river, etc etc etc so you can leave the ancient temple.

Oh yeah, ancient. They don't have brain interfaces and distant waveforming movement like we do these days!
